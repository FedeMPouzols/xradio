    "XRADIO is an open-source Python package that leverages [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) to provide an interface for radio astronomy data. It utilizes the following data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [```xarray Datasets```](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html): These are collections of labeled n-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- ```XRADIO Processing Sets```: These are collections of ```xarray Datasets```, a data structure that XRADIO implements.\n",
    "\n",
    "XRADIO is in the process of providing access to the following types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observation data: Interferometer Data (Visibilities) and Single Dish data (Spectrum), housed in ```Processing Sets (PS)```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Currently being implemented</span>]\n",
    "- Sky and Aperture Images, stored in ```xarray Datasets```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Partially implemented; schema design ongoing</span>]\n",
    "- Aperture Zernike Models, contained in ```xarray Datasets```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Schema design in progress</span>]\n",
    "- Calibration data, located in ```xarray Datasets```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Schema design in progress</span>]\n",
    "- Simulation component lists, found in ```xarray Datasets```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Schema design in progress</span>]\n",

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to use the [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) environment manager to create a clean, self-contained runtime where ```XRADIO``` and all its dependencies can be installed:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda create --name xradio python=3.11 --no-default-packages\n",
    "conda activate xradio\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> üìù On macOS it is required to pre-install `python-casacore` using `conda install -c conda-forge python-casacore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making xradio available for download from conda-forge directly is pending, so until then the current recommendation is to sully that pristine environment by calling pip [from within conda](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment), like this:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install xradio\n",
    "```"

    "The description and selection of data in `XRADIO` is based on `xarray`. To use `XRADIO` effectively, it's crucial to understand the terminology and indexing methods used in `xarray`. Here are some important resources:\n",

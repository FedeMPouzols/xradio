    "XRADIO is an open-source Python package that leverages [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) to provide an interface for radio astronomy data. It utilizes the following data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [```xarray Datasets```](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html): These are collections of labeled n-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- ```XRADIO Processing Sets```: These are collections of ```xarray Datasets```, a data structure that XRADIO implements.\n",
    "\n",
    "XRADIO is in the process of providing access to the following types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observation data: Interferometer Data (Visibilities) and Single Dish data (Spectrum), housed in ```Processing Sets (PS)```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Currently being implemented</span>]\n",
    "- Sky and Aperture Images, stored in ```xarray Datasets```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Partially implemented; schema design ongoing</span>]\n",
    "- Aperture Zernike Models, contained in ```xarray Datasets```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Schema design in progress</span>]\n",
    "- Calibration data, located in ```xarray Datasets```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Schema design in progress</span>]\n",
    "- Simulation component lists, found in ```xarray Datasets```. [<span style=\"color:red\">Schema design in progress</span>]\n",
    "- And more...\n",

    "The goal of the XRADIO library is to establish a new standard for handling radio interferometry data, especially visibilities. \n",
    "It is envisioned to act as a successor to the \"measurement set\" format (see e.g. https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/229.pdf or \n",
    "https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/264.pdf) that has been used to represent visibility data in storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aims of the library are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on existing Python libraries established in data science, like\n",
    "  :py:mod:`numpy`, :py:mod:`xarray` and :py:mod:`dask`\n",
    "* As much as possible compatibility / interoperability with common\n",
    "  libraries used for atrophysics, like :py:mod:`astropy`.\n",
    "* Adding well-defined methods for checking schemas\n",
    "* Covering more use cases as appropriate, such as images or working with\n",
    "  in-memory data\n"

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to use the conda environment manager from [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to create a clean, self-contained runtime where XRADIO and all its dependencies can be installed:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda create --name xradio python=3.12 --no-default-packages\n",
    "conda activate xradio\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> üìù On macOS it is required to pre-install `python-casacore` using `conda install -c conda-forge python-casacore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making XRADIO available for download from conda-forge directly is pending, so until then the current recommendation is to sully that pristine environment by calling pip [from within conda](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment), like this:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install xradio\n",

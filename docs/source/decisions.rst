Design decisions log
====================

The following objectives were formulated for this collaboration:

* Create and document a new visibility data schema that is scalable and
  maintainable, satisfying the use cases of the NRAO and SKA. The documentation
  should be independently reviewed by experts for each of the use cases.
* Implement a prototype in Python using off-the-shelf packages (such as xarray,
  dask, etc.) that can read and write data in the format of the new schema and
  convert measurement set v2.

Our aim is to build a system that is viable long-term, so we must make care to
sufficiently discuss and document design decision we make. The following table
lists some decisions made, indicating status of the discussion and short
rationale.

Language (decided)
------------------

**Decision:** Python

Previously, C++ has often been seen as the primary implementation language for
data exchange. However, there is a substantial and growing trend to use Python
for purposes of high-level programming in scientific fields. This is due to its
flexibility working with various data formats, and it's well-established
infrastructure of dealing with numeric data (chiefly based on numpy).

On Python version: For the moment we are aiming to support Python versions that
are not currently "end-of-life" according to
https://devguide.python.org/versions/

License (decided)
-----------------

**Decision:** BSD3

SKAO preference, has been checked to be okay with NRAO. Note that this means
that no dependencies can be GPL - but LGPL is permissable.

Name (decided)
--------------

**Decision:** xradio (https://github.com/casangi/xradio)

Want to be reasonably indicative at what it is - "measurement set" is a bit too
general. However, also want to keep the door open to include data models beyond
visibilities in the future. Also don't want to stick a "ng" somewhere to invoke
the "next generation CASA" project.

* pyrat (python radio astronomy tools), trapy (tools for radio astronomy
  python), pytra (python tools for radio astronomy), astropyrat,
  astroradius, â€¦
* radex or radax (radio astronomy data exchange format) - pyradex already taken
  on PyPI, but radax is still available
* vidax (visibility data exchange format) - still available on PyPI
* combination of the two: ravix (radio astronomy visibility exchange format) - still available on PyPI
* xradio (xarray radio astronomy data I/O library?) - bonus points for semi-recursive acronym!

xradio won the poll.

Goals (decided)
---------------

**Decision:** Library to allow construction of consistent xarray-based data structures for radio interferometry

* Document
* Construct
* Convert
* Check

We want this library to gather shared assumptions about our radio astronomy
data models. This is primarily about the conventions used when interacting with
the xarray API, i.e. what datasets and data arrays contain in terms of
dimensions, coordinates, data arrays, attributes - their names, dimensions (if
applicable), data types and associated semantics (description, units, etc).

Developers and users should be able to use this library to:

* determining whether a certain data structure is compliant - and if so, how it
  is to be interpreted in detail
  
  * to some degree, this can be achieved simply by having the data structure be
    self-describing, and leaning on xarray's rules (i.e. coordinate-data
    variable association, and descriptive attributes)
  * however, for this to work as exchange format, we will need to also check
    and document more detailed conventions (completeness, semantic descriptions
    etc).
* easily generate compliant data structures

  * allow generating APIs from lower-level APIs (e.g. dask or numpy arrays) We
    will have to assume that there are going to be a large number of possible
    producers for this data - especially processing functions. For instance,
    given that xarray can be a front for dask arrays, it is a valid use case to
    wrap an entire computation graph behind an xradio-compliant API
  * allow conversion of existing formats. Measurement set v2/3 being the
    obvious first step
